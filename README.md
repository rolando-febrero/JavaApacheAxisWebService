# JavaApacheAxisWebService

Creating and deploying a simple WebService is not as hard as you think. For this example we are going to work with Apache Axis WebService. Axis is essentially a SOAP engine ,a framework for constructing SOAP processors such as clients, servers, gateways, etc.
Apache Axis is a SOAP toolkit that makes it easy to create, deploy, and consume web services. By using Axis, you will be able to quickly convert existing Java functionality into web services, deploy those services, and be able to communicate with them remotely via the Internet, usually through firewalls (if necessary).

More precisely, Axis is an implementation of SOAP. Most people like to think of it as a toolkit. From the programmer's point of view, it's like an API. It makes it easy for you to communicate - with SOAP - to a remote object, without having to worry about the details associated with the protocol. In practice, it is a lot like using RPC, CORBA, RMI, or any of the other distributed computing technologies you may have experience with. The process is largely the same: you describe the target of your communication, invoke the remote method and marshall your parameters, and then demarshall the return values. Since AXIS makes this process simpler than ever, development is a breeze.

Well, let's start coding...
For this example we are going to use:
- Java (here I'm using JDK 1.7)
- Apache Tomcat v7.xx
- Eclipse Luna

Install Apache Tomcat and add it to Eclipse... File --> New --> Other. Type in server, and follow the wizard.
